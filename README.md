This is the repository for my CMPE 131 project at SJSU back in 2016: TypeIO!

This is a website built in Ruby on Rails designed to allow users to colloborate with another by creating posts and comments on a bulletin board for any topic.

Other developers include: Parvathy Menon, Vijay Dhanota, Grant Haack.

Feel free to look through our images of the site! Thank you for taking the time to look at this.
